# About this RPG
This RPG is made in Unity. It is based on the RPG tutorial by inScopeStudios.com. 

## Help, Debugging, and code snippets
This section is for things like what exit points are and where I added them (and when I added them as well).

**Exit Points**
* These allow (in this game) us to control where the spell is cast from on the staff. If we hadn't of added these, the spells would come from the nose of the player. This is described in [Episode 3.1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD_Bpcy_p5s)
