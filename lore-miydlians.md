title: Miydlian Lore
description: >
	The Miydlians were possibly the first intelligent species to arise across the stars, and they were the first to advocate for a universal governing body. They're classified as "living crystal aliens", after the slang name for beings from the world of Horrucun. They've spent the eons exploring, crafting and researching, but don't expect them to be push-overs: they are incredibly good manufacturers of weapons and possess super strength, and they've never lost a war.
