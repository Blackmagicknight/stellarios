title: Miydlian Lore
description: >
  The Miydlians were possibly the first intelligent species to arise across the
  stars, and they were the first to advocate for a universal governing body.
  They're classified as "living crystal aliens", after the slang name for beings
  from the world of Horrucun. They've spent the eons exploring, crafting and
  researching, but don't expect them to be push-overs': they are incredibly good
  manufacturers of weapons and possess super strength, and they've never lost a
  war.

# Notable Miydlians

# A history of miydlians
Today, very few Miydlians exist, after a recent plague wiped out large numbers of the population of the Miydlians. Those that remain mostly live on the first alien planets that they inhabited after spreading out from Midgard, many millions of years ago. 

| Time Period | Years Ago | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [The Age of Origin](#the-age-of-origin) | 8 billion to 18 million years ago | While no intelligent life existed during this period, the seeds of the Miydlians were laid during this Age. |
| [The Occult Era](#the-occult-era) | 18 million to 5.6 million years ago | The Occult Era is so named due to the mystery behind the creation of the race of Miydlians |
| [The Aeon of Development](#the-aeon-of-development) | 5.6 million to 5.5 million years ago | Small communities banded together during this period of mass discovery and industrial development to form the first cities on Midgard |
| [The Era of Neglect](#the-era-of-neglect) | 5.5 million to 5.45 million years ago | While the small number of explorarory Miydlians prospered, the masses did not and many starved in what was possibly the first mass extinction of intelligent life ever. |

# A note from Liam
When we originally created Star Sailors on the [old portal](https://blog.acord.software/post/611947364722360320/ac0rd-digest-our-network-ambitions), we came up with a number of species and lore regarding them, including:

* Miydlians
* Cancrinites
* Keplernians
* Icites
* Miydlians

As we started to flesh out a little about what Star Sailors would be like, I came up with this bio for Miydlians:

> The Miydlias were the first species to succesfully colonize a large portion of the galaxy, and they did so roughly 15000 years ago. A war-loving people, the Miydlias were infamous for their conquests, where they would invade planets to further their cause.
After they left their homeworld (which has since been lost to our records) they settled on a volcanic planet called Miydli, which is where they got their name from. Over millenia, the Miydlias terraformed the planet to be the snowy capital of the galaxy that we called Midgard (of the Midgard Legacy).

(Liam Arbuckle, 2019)

However, I began to come up with the name "Midgard" for the galactic Parliament after the Miydlians, and also from some mythological stories. [Midgard in norse mythology](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Midgard) refers to "Middle Earth", or the abode of mankind, and the "gard" part (in my mind) referred to the fact that the Parliament was a "guard" to protect the galaxy/universe. I came up with the name Mi*d*g*ard*ia*c*osl, for the capital ship of the people, and I began to question if the first group to create a massive civilization would really be war-loving. I've kept this here to reference our earlier work, and the old lore is freely visible to AC0/RD members at [the gitlab repo](https://gitlab.com/acord-robotics/robodev/star-sailors/-/tree/starsailorsearthlings/star-sailors-earthlings). It's possible that the original ideas for the Miydlians' characteristics could apply to another species, or better yet - a "splinter group" of Miydlians. Time will tell, and the entire community can chip in with your thoughts.

* [Names](http://fantasynamegenerators.com)

> Cereans are a sentient species of humanoids, and are distinguished by their elongated heads. Their heads are so tall because they have two brains, which are supplied with blood by their two hearts. Besides this feature they look relatively human in comparison to many other species.
Cereans are force-sensitive beings as well, in fact, Ki-Adi-Mundi served as both a Jedi Master and member of the Jedi High Council for years.

> Cerean names are very diverse, often with a hyphen or two in the case of male names. There are only about a dozen named female Cereans, none of which have any hyphens like many male names do. Not all male names contain a hyphen though, which just adds to the diversity.

> Besides these hyphens, Cerean names tend to be melodic, relatively easy to pronounce, and fairly short. Even the longer names are just two or three short names linked with hyphens. There are always exceptions though.

> Surnames can be longer at times however, as can female names based on the small sample group, but short names are more common.

# More Ideas
* Medieval humans somehow made contact w/ aliens/god-like beings, got whisked away
* Opus (few hundred years in the future) -> meet the old humans, who underwent very different cybernetic & natural evolutionary augmentations
