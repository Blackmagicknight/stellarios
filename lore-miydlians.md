title: Miydlian Lore
description: >
  The Miydlians were possibly the first intelligent species to arise across the stars, and they were the first to advocate for a universal governing body. They're classified as "living crystal aliens", after the slang name for beings from the world of Horrucun. They''ve spent the eons exploring, crafting and researching, but don''t expect them to be push-overs': they are incredibly good manufacturers of weapons and possess super strength, and they've never lost a war.

### Star Sailors - Miydlian Lore


# A note from Liam
When we originally created Star Sailors on the [old portal](https://blog.acord.software/post/611947364722360320/ac0rd-digest-our-network-ambitions), we came up with a number of species and lore regarding them, including:

* Miydlians
* Cancrinites
* Keplernians
* Icites
* Miydlians

As we started to flesh out a little about what Star Sailors would be like, I came up with this bio for Miydlians:

> The Miydlias were the first species to succesfully colonize a large portion of the galaxy, and they did so roughly 15000 years ago. A war-loving people, the Miydlias were infamous for their conquests, where they would invade planets to further their cause.
After they left their homeworld (which has since been lost to our records) they settled on a volcanic planet called Miydli, which is where they got their name from. Over millenia, the Miydlias terraformed the planet to be the snowy capital of the galaxy that we called Midgard (of the Midgard Legacy).

However, I began to come up with the name "Midgard" for the galactic Parliament after the Miydlians, and also from some mythological stories. [Midgard in norse mythology](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Midgard) refers to "Middle Earth", or the abode of mankind, and the "gard" part (in my mind) referred to the fact that the Parliament was a "guard" to protect the galaxy/universe. I came up with the name Mi*d*g*ard*ia*c*osl, for the capital ship,
