title: Star Sailors Lore: Humans
description: >-
	The most intelligent species from Planet Earth, *Homo Sapiens* (AKA Humans) were initially dominant in space exploration, but due to their militaristic and tribalistic nature, scientific & technological pursuits and advancements were put on the backburner for some time as a series of wars and subsequent failed attempts at peace took center stage. Homo Sapiens only recently rediscovered the joys of space exploration, after their entire solar system was sabotaged for a time immediately after the Cosmosum Drought, when the senators of the Midgard Parliament helped to assimilate them into the universal family. Today, the humans are spread throughout the galaxy, as they seem to have not yet shaken the prehistoric urge to repopulate and spread their seed throughout the universe. This urge has seen them take over the four corners of the universe in much the same way as they took over the four corners of planet Earth over many thousands of years. While many continue to live on Earth, they are no longer separated or divided from the rest of civilization, and have become great architects of defensive architecture, weapons and have produced some of the greatest athletes Midgardia has ever seen. The defensive architecture style so loved by humans has helped with the redesign of the Parliament, which has been called "Midgardiacosl" for a time after the mythological Midylian name for the universe, as well as the creation of new sports stadiums for every weird and unusual sport played by the humans on Earth, as well as the ones created by the galaxy's other species.

# Star Sailors Lore: Humans
Contents:

| Lore | Description | 
|---|---|
| [Sports](#sports) | Since the dawn of mankind, sports have been a huge part of the humans' societies. |

## Sports
While there are no sports teams that only have one-species, the teams that have done the best in the popular Infiniraid & Hocxksbul are predominantly the ones with large numbers of humans on the team. This is thought to be due to their insane desire to win and their competitiveness.

# Notes
* Galaxies & universes are interchangeable, I've just used galaxy/galaxies sometimes to mix it up a bit. The Parliament is essentially a collective group of parliaments/senates around the entire universe.
