# Lore for Star Sailors

{% include utterances.html %}

When I started out writing Star Sailors, I knew that I wanted it to be an expansive and open-world universe, with the possibility - indeed, the neccessity - for expansion upon what I originally build. While I had no idea that I would later be creating a video game based on the novel, my ideas regarding the open-worldness have helpfully been very useful when designing the game as well.

Backstory - not just for the characters, but even for inanimate objects sometimes - is one of the most important things that we can do for the development of the story.

> The lore of a game is its backstory, all the elements that complement the principal narrative. These details add depth and richness to the universe of a video game, expanding its history outside the main plot. It is an aspect that is sometimes overlooked by developers, which is a mistake. Good lore writing is essential to engage players, and a good way to offer them more than the base title.

I've spent a lot of money and time reading through books about writing stories and world building, and after also devouring online material about this subject, it's evident to me that writing lore is a great way to engage the player/reader in the content, and thanks to the internet, we're all able to contribute to the lore of a game or a story, which will be a great thing for our future.
