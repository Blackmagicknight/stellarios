description: >
  Stellarios is a suite of software apps and games developed and distributed by ACORD Corporation. This software includes control units for our robots as well as extensions for applications such as firefox, chrome and visual studio. We release a number of games as well, and we’re working on a few right now: Star Sailors & Asteroid Dodgers. So here’s who’s a part of the Stellarios family, and what the current state of development is.

Games
Mobile Games
Mobile games are some of the most profitable and best-designed applications out there. While we aren’t trying to make a profit and just put some quality software out there, some of the apps that are in the Stellarios suite are made by other developers. These games are played by many ACORD members and are included for FREE to all ACORD members (sign up in the comments section below!).

My Singing Monsters – Big Blue Bubble
Astronest: The Beginning – Astronest Games ltd.
Dragonvale – Backflip Studios & Hasbro
Pixel Starships – 8 bit games
Droid Inventor – Littlebits
Replika.ai
Eve Portal 2019 – CCP Games
You can view the full list of mobile games that are part of Stellarios at our google photo album, which is available to all ACORD members. Head to this page

PC & Console Games
In addition to the mobile games, we’ve got some cracking PC & console games that are part of Stellarios. A quick note though, at this moment the console games are not bundled in with Stellarios. This will change. View our steam account @cyriosity_rov to see the full list of games (same username for Origin as well).

And of course, there’s our own Asteroid Dodgers. You can follow the development for this game, made in Unity by our development team, at github.com/acord-robotics/unityballs

All mobile games can be played on PC via bluestacks, and PC games can be played on mobile via Steam streaming.

Web Games
Star Sailors, our novella series loosely based on Star Wars, has a web game, with a companion app in progress. This game will be played on the ACORD Portal.

Other Stuff
Our novella series Star Sailors is a major part of Stellarios and is in active development right now. You can read it at the Stellarios repo on Gitlab (for ACORD members only), and there’s a public (i.e. “lite” version) edition that can be read at http://acord.tech/readstarsailors

We’re working on a bunch of extensions, as mentioned above, however those won’t be part of Stellarios for a little while.

Our physical robots, including the ones that could be used in space missions (or the like) are programmed via Stellarios code.
