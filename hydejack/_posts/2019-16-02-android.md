  In this post, I’ll be walking you through our automatic posting system, thanks to Integromat, Zapier & IFTTT. There have also been a few changes to our commenting and forum systems on the portal, a revamped subreddit, and so much more. Nicholas & I will also quickly talk about our native app, which has been a number of years in the making – we hope you enjoy!
