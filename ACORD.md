# Robots & Software

At ACORD, we intend to create robots and software for every purpose. Want a rover to explore Mars? We'll make it. Need a game made? We'll code it. ACORD is a not-for-profit organisation that seeks to design, develop and package creations that will go out and do good in the world.

Stellarios is part of that good that we will do. With Stellarios, you can control any product made by ACORD. It comes with some cool games as well! Everything on Stellarios can be run on mobile, PC, and Mac/Linux.

## Robots

Our robots serve a variety of purposes. Our main project at this time, A0-D2, is being created for a variety of reasons - 

* [Testing & Developing Stellarios](/stellarios/testing) - The physical robot will be connected to a "virtual robot" inside Stellarios, meaning you can take your robot anywhere
* [Science Experiments](/stellarios/science) - Learn about our science work here
* [Companion for people with disabilities](/stellarios/companion) - Learn about our "companion robots" here

## Games in Stellarios

### Made by us

* [Asteroid Dodgers](http://github.com/acord-robotics/unityballs) - Our first game, in Asteroid Dodgers you fly a ship around collecting artifacts and - you guessed it - dodging asteroids

### Other games

Some games that we think are worthy of being in Stellarios are included. These games have personally bought us great happiness playing them and they are truly innovative. You can view these games at this [repo](http://github.com/acord-robotics/stellarios/blob/master/README.md) and if you want to add games to it, fork [this repo](http://github.com/acord-robotics/stellarios-sugestions) to tell us about them!



# Stellarios Map

This will be kind of how Stellarios will be laid out. We have a [scratch project](scratch.mit.edu/projects/323541078) which shows how the applications will look.

# Science by ACORD

ACORD is a big believer in science and community science, and that's why we're looking to partner with companies that are involved in science and exploration. Our robots will be the next step in humanity's chapter. 

# Grand plan

A0-D2 will have:

* Stellarios - with all ACORD media
* DNA of ACORD encoded into Stellarios

Launch into space

* Take photo of earth
