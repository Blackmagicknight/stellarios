__The screen fades from black into the command center of a space station, which is actually an extension of a planet. Animated characters run past the you (currently you are in the third-person). A command table<sup>1</sup> is in front of you, with small, holographic figures (these are not pixel-art) moving across the top. __
<center> ****CONSOLE CPU****<sup>2</sup> </center>
<center> "What was that?" </center>
__The screen shakes as one of the spaceships on the table flies off the table.__
<center> ****OPUS**** </center>
<center> "Hi! My name's Opus...sorry we haven't got more time
