# Chapter 9

It’s been a long journey. Sorry for not writing sooner.

Gilbert was made fleet commander last week. He was very proud, and he promised to wear the jacket with pride. We’re sitting together now, on the Curiosity station. I’ll still be a proud protectorate member, but I like some time off and I feel like building the garden.

Speaking of which, the garden is looking great! I’ve finished furnishing Mars (TerraGenesis Photo), and we’ve got some life bumping up there. I’ve been struggling to figure out exactly how I want to organise my garden. I’ll get back to that soon.

Gilbert’s relishing his duty as Leader of the ACoRD Protectorate. He still misses me a bit, but we see each other in the garden every now and then. He knows I’ll finish working soon, and we can get back to saving the galaxy. Alex Vicheva always told me that Gilbert was a liability, but I knew that Gilbert wasn’t – and more than that, he was my best friend. Alek saw that eventually. We all miss Alex. Even when he said things that sounded harsh, we knew that he had the interests of the crew at heart. He was often wrong, but he was selfless, brave, and cunning. The galaxy is a poorer place without him.

The galaxy may be free of all evil, but we’ve got other places to take care of other galaxies as well. That’s next on my bucket list – and I’m pleased to announce the garden is complete!

We’ve got a 10-way binary star system, which is quite confusing but I’ve gotten used to it –

    A pulsar
    Blue Supergiant
    Red Supergiant
    Red Giant
    Yellow dwarf
    Red dwarf
    Orange dwarf
    White dwarf
    Black dwarf/hole
    White giant

All the stars are perfectly balanced, and each star can be access by my portal app on my Stellarios device. We start in the planet around the blue supergiant:

    Blue supergiant: 1 planet
        8 Astronomical Units away
        Life? Yes – microbial
        Experiments: heat-related
    Pulsar: 8 planets
        All planets – 5-9 AU
        Life? Yes
        Experiments: electricity, radiation
    All others (except Yellow & Red dwarf):
        5 planets
        Life? Yes
        Experiments: life
    Red dwarf: 7 planets (Trappist)
        Life? Yes
        Planets: 1,1.3,1.4,1.8,2,8,9 AU
        Life? Yes
        Experiments: life, solar flares, solar radiation

Now we come to my home system, the real garden

    Mars: Intelligent life (6 genus)
        I store my protectorate gear here
        All my Space Ball prizes are here as well
        I conduct research to do with the development of life as well as changing states of matter (water)
    Earth: as it was
        I’ve got Earth as it was before I left. The humans see everything the way it is, but they don’t know what’s going on. One day they will (book 3)
    Every other planet (the way it was, will add more to this)
    Stellarios/Siridium:
        We’ve got a nice colony, sort of laid out like a modern lab in a jungle
        Everything is stored here – droids,
        Opus is actually a Cancrinite, but has every species
        White marble arm (made of siridium) – right arm
        Siridium arm –
            Controls the universe
            Siridium star (pulses different colours, but by default is gold) control panel
            Pressing the button allows Opus to select different modes:
            Universe hopper, Storage, Devices, Experiments, Droid cPanel, Droids, Spaceships, Collections, Communication, Aliens, Weapons)
            Each brings up a holographic display
            Cannot be removed
            Can store things
        Does kill people (after constructing arm), however their essence goes into universe hopper where they can start afresh
        Basically a gauntlet, with a spaceship
        Starbound-themed spaceship/tardis/starfighter
        Means Opus can live forever, universe is never destroyed, arm can’t be removed – everything can go into arm (and i mean everything from the entire multiverse network)
        Finds materials and constructs/develops arm at the end of the first book
        Planetary garden (finds planets in Chapter 7)
        Portal to star wars

It’s been a long journey, and I’m glad to say that Opus Siridium is retired. That chapter has been written. I’ll stay here in this garden forevermore, but my new name is *Vetrur, after the great warrior and protectorate member. Goodbye Opus, hello Vetrur. I've been awarded the Star of Siridium for my services to the universe, and I've used this to earn a position as Lieutenant of the Miydlian Fleet and to earn my stripes and medals in the fleet. No matter what happens, the essence of everyone and everything will survive.

(Adventures of Opus)
## The story of my ship
My ship, the Midgardiacosl, is a real beauty, and it powers my marble arm. The powerful reactor uses nuclear fusion to fuse together the nuclei of every element in existence to form a marble substance. With the recent discoveries by Industrial Automaton and the other *swcombine* corporations, and the research and development by ACoRD, has meant that number of elements has swarmed to many thousands. Not all of them are surrounded by electrons; in fact one of the reasons why Midgard was chosen as the centre of the universe was because of a unique core of metallic silicon, similar to the metallic hydrogen and helium on gas giant planets like Jupiter & Saturn in our system. 

This meant that the silicon ions became surrounded by a new type of subatomic particle. It was only named recently, after me - the Opdus boson. It was a huge honour, as I had helped lead the team that discovered this boson. Previously, it had created properties on the planet (which I will explain below) that had made natives and explorers alike feel akin to this world.

The coordinates of Midgard are L6S5/2RD;A0D2.

* Ship designed in Space Engineers, NMS, MC (inspiration from these + AoD Formation fandom (supernatural, Harry Potter, SW, etc)
See the specs for it here: https://gitlab.com/acord-robotics/robodev/s2rd/issues/12#note_253626282

I went into a Siridium star. The cool thing about this was it had an atom called Stel, or Stellarios, which is basically silicon, carbon, oxygen and hydrogen bonded together with an Opdus boson. This made it essentially one atom, like a binary/tri-binary network of stars. This is how I created my reactor. I had to display courage for the Star, which is semi-sentient, to be able to let me in. Without the battles we had fought in and the Infiniraid games I would have struggled.

The ship has a shape like Anakin Skywalker's SWCW fighter, with a ring around the cockpit which is connected via energy spikes. These energy spikes allow rapid transport of items between the ring (which powers the hyperflux capacitor) and the transfer of people. The cockpit has little droids on the hatch, and the interior of the cockpit has a rover. This rover has different functions, and stays inside my consciousness, my Sirdium arm and the ship. One of the modes is the controls, and the other modes are described above in the Siridium app.
