### Terragenesis

Terragenesis, developed by Edgeworks entertainment, is a space colonization game available for AnDroidOS and iDroidOS. In Terragenesis you pick a planet (for example Mars), and research technology that is used to make your planet more liveable, for example oxygen generators.

The application is really nicely designed and will provide an inspiration for our application. For example, the menu system of Terragenesis will be copied into the DroidOS app. Once you’ve opened a planet in Terragenesis, you see the current state of the planet (for example, a green, lush globe), and this will also be used in the app. See the droid controller section for more.

#### TG Stats
* Mercury: 100% (beginner, daughters of gaia)
* Venus: 100% (beginner, united nations)
* Earth: 20% (normal, biosphere, horizon corporation)
* Mars: 100% (beginner, daughters of gaia)
* Moon: 100% (normal, biosphere, united nations)

Once youve opened the droid control part of the app, you’ll be able to select which model of Droid you want to control (including virtual droids.). Once you’ve selected your model, the droid will be slowly spinning around, with different parts of the droid corresponding to different functions (touching the feet will select the movement function, for example).

### Backflip Studio Games
Backflip studios have made a number of awesome games that I've played, including Dragonvale (World) and Gizmonauts (a space & robotics colony game). Backflip studio games emphasise collection of different objects (like dragons) of different types, and the housing of these objects in different habitats. Some stellarios games will follow this model as well, with robots &  aliens being collected, sorted, bred, etc.
