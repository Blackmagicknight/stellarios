"Can you send him into my office?" The chancellor spoke into his comlink with a big smile on his face. Finally, he'd get the chance to speak to an alien. And not just someone from a different species. No, this was someone - or rather something - that was completely alien in the true sense of the word, both to his culture and to his galaxy. "That's great, he's here now?  Send him in, please."  He paused for a moment. "Yes, I want you to put them into the barracks, train them up, explain what's going on. Provide them a video link to this room, I'll speak with them as well. We're not barbarians." 

The door slid open and a metallic sound played. In walked Starrix Lierge, Miydlian Fleet Commander, and the human - whooman? Hyman? - the alien. The alien sat down in a chair before he was directed to sit down, but Jayin let it go. This was all new to him. Did these aliens have chairs where they come from - how else would he have known to sit down? All these questions buzzed around in his brains like a hive of bees, and while this was often one of his greatest strengths, right now he needed his full attention on the alien. He turned on a translator application on his comlink and began to talk.

Gilbert was led into the wide room by the tall, blue alien that had drugged him earlier. His body responded to his commands completely and he seemed to be free of the drug, but there was no way to know for sure until he tried something. He blinked a few times as his eyes were watering continuously - it was an incredibly bright environment that he was in, and although he didn't know it yet, Jayin's species needed bright lights to function.
