# Stellarios
Stellarios is a suite of software being developed by ACORD Robotics. This software includes games, applications and tools used in a variety of situations, for example software used to control explorartory rovers. The ACORD only version is being developed on Gitlab/Acord-Robotics/Robodev/S2RD and Github/IrisDroidology/S2RD

Every member of ACORD gets the ACORD package of Stellarios, which includes:
* All "droid" blueprints & build logs
* All "holograms" (video archives)
* Virtual companion robot
* All ACORD "Jedi Archives"
* Star Sailors (novella series) - special edition

Stellarios is free for personal and commercial use and is open-source. Joining ACORD is free and gets you plenty of cool stuff only available to ACORD members. It's easy to sign up - go to http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/signup

# Asteroid Dodgers
Asteroid Dodgers is a game created by ACORD in collaboration with [@Orgzy-Design](http://github.com/orgzy-design) (our Chairman's company). It is a slight parody on Star Sailors and is part of the RPG family.

## Development
__What's going on?__
Currently we are working on developing Asteroid Dodgers in the Unity Game Engine. Level 2 is what is being developed, as well as the main menu.

## Level 1
Explore the galaxy and find "alien artifacts"

## Level 2
Bring those artifacts back to your base

# Installation of Stellarios
Stellarios can be installed by ACORD members at [the portal](http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/star-sailors-embed). For everyone else, download this git repository. There is currently no single executable file for the whole of Stellarios, there are individual executables for the different games and apps in Stellarios
