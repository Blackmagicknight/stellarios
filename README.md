# Stellarios
Stellarios is a suite of software being developed by ACORD Robotics. This software includes games, applications and tools used in a variety of situations, for example software used to control explorartory rovers. The ACORD only version is being developed on Gitlab/Acord-Robotics/Robodev/S2RD and Github/IrisDroidology/S2RD.

# Discussion

Every member of ACORD gets the ACORD package of Stellarios, which includes:
* All "droid" blueprints & build logs
* All "holograms" (video archives)
* Virtual companion robot
* All ACORD "Jedi Archives"
* Star Sailors (novella series) - special edition
* Star Sailors RPG access on ACORD portal

Stellarios is free for personal and commercial use and is open-source. Joining ACORD is free and gets you plenty of cool stuff only available to ACORD members. It's easy to sign up - go to http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/signup

# Stellarios Droids
Droids, or robots, are a major part of the work that ACORD Robotics does. These robots will be used for a variety of purposes, including scientific exploration ([NASA-JPL](http://github.com/nasa-jpl)), mental health stability (Blue Frog Robotics), and other uses.

Our prototype of our master droid, A0-D2 (7), or S2-RD (43), is being built and has been worked on since the formation of ACORD/AoD, however we physically started working on it at the end of 2017. The parts list is available here: [acord.tech/partslist](https://irisdroidology.github.io/otr/meeting-with-adventures/)

# ACORD Robotics/Stellarios/Acord-Games
A large part of the Stellarios software suite by ACORD is our games. These games are made both by us and by other developers (for example Backflip Studios, CCP Games, Hello Games, etc). Here's a list of all our games, the [ACORD world backups](http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/forums/forum/droidologists/aod-game-worlds/) and more.
