## ACORD Portal
### Plugins
* [Buddypress custom background by BUDDYDEV](https://buddydev.com/plugins/bp-custom-background-for-user-profile/)
* [ACORD Portal](http://gitlab.com/acord-robotics) - Still a wip

### Portal Pages
#### Stellarios
Stellarios is available for ACORD members on the portal. Every single application that has been created is on its own page:
* [Stellarios Portal](http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/stellarios)
* [Star Sailors Game](http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/stellarios/star-sailors)
* [Minigames](http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/stellarios/minigames)

### Resources
You can find out how the portal works here: http://acord.tech/portal-help

### Gitlab
We're going to be using Gitlab as a secondary git client. Gitlab and Github will be filled up with more projects and people once we've got more active members (however we will be attempting to get 1 contribution each day on each git client).

* [Gitlab Group](http://gitlab.com/acord-robotics)
* [Gitlab Profile](http://gitlab.com/irisdroidology)

* [Gitlab Repo](http://gitlab.com/acord-robotics/robodev/s2rd)

The github repository will be made private once we upgrade to a more expensive Github plan. Then both the gitlab and github clients will be private

# Maintenance
This repo has been moved to *gitlab/acord-robotics/robodev/stellarios*
Any changes on github will be reflected in gitlab. Bitbucket? This is to ensure that online cloud-based IDE code editors can be used. Gitpod is currently our editor of choice.

This repo on acord.tech/github will be used for jekyll only, however it will still be updated from gitlab.
Backing up: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/raketasks/backup_restore.html#rsync, https://gitlab.com/acord-robotics/robodev/star-sailors/issues/9

## ACORD Members Stuff
* Chairman's stuff: http://acord.tech/opus
The theme we're thinking of using is https://github.com/artemsheludko/adam-blog. This could also be used for the Star Sailors blog - this repo is now for the book navigation.  We forked that repo: http://github.com/irisdroidology/otr


# Stellarios
Stellarios is the official operating system and app of ACORD. Stellarios will be designed to work on MacOS & Windows devices, and there will be apps created for Android, iOS & Linux devices. Stellarios is going to be a bundle of applications that will be used by ACORD Corporation members to perform certain operations. 

## Applications
### Droid Control App
Our droids (companion, scientific, etc) will be able to be controlled from this part of Stellarios. Once you click on the button to send you to the droid control app, you will select the type of droid you want to pair with (companion, scientific), then the class (steampunk, et, etc), then the model name (Sp-D2, a0-d2, etc. 

Once you've selected your droid, you will find a cross-section diagram of your droid with different parts highlighted - 

* Legs = movement
* Holoprojector = talk/message (http://replika.ai)
* Dome/Head = Programs

#### Dome
Clicking on the dome will zoom in on the dome and give you a number of programs -
* Battery - low battery mode. The physical droid will turn off and send itself to your phone or device. This means you can interact with a virtual version of your droid
* Games - games like Star Sailors. Hosted on the app, and your offline progress sent to the servers. There will be online features too that require an internet connection
* Science - experiments, research, tools
* Writing/Drawing/Art
* will be able to control our droids and play or games, like A0-D2 and Star Sailors 
* Can interact with replika.ai

## Other applications
* Other games, mini-games

# Stellarios
Stellarios is a suite of software being developed by ACORD Robotics. This software includes games, applications and tools used in a variety of situations, for example software used to control explorartory rovers. The ACORD only version is being developed on Gitlab/Acord-Robotics/Robodev/S2RD and Github/IrisDroidology/S2RD.

# Discussion

Every member of ACORD gets the ACORD package of Stellarios, which includes:
* All "droid" blueprints & build logs
* All "holograms" (video archives)
* Virtual companion robot
* All ACORD "Jedi Archives"
* Star Sailors (novella series) - special edition
* Star Sailors RPG access on ACORD portal

Stellarios is free for personal and commercial use and is open-source. Joining ACORD is free and gets you plenty of cool stuff only available to ACORD members. It's easy to sign up - go to http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/signup

# Stellarios Droids
Droids, or robots, are a major part of the work that ACORD Robotics does. These robots will be used for a variety of purposes, including scientific exploration ([`NASA-JPL` Open-Source-Rover](http://github.com/nasa-jpl)), mental health stability (Blue Frog Robotics), and other uses.

Our prototype of our master droid, A0-D2 (7), or S2-RD (43), or L6-S5 is being built and has been worked on since the formation of ACORD/AoD, however we physically started working on it at the end of 2017. The parts list is available here: [acord.tech/partslist](https://irisdroidology.github.io/otr/meeting-with-adventures/)

A0-D2 Build Log: https://acord-robotics.github.io/stellarios/a0d2-log

# Installation of Stellarios
Stellarios can be installed by ACORD members at [the portal](http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/star-sailors-embed). For everyone else, download this git repository. There is currently no single executable file for the whole of Stellarios, there are individual executables for the different games and apps in Stellarios

# Support

# Developers of ACORD/Stellarios
* Liam Arbuckle (@IrisDroidology) - Lead developer - [My Website](http://irisdroidology.github.io/portfolio)
* @mfaridn03 - Farid
* @j-brkr 
* @exynos-999 - Machine Learning Developer

# ACORD Robotics/Stellarios/Acord-Games
A large part of the Stellarios software suite by ACORD is our games. These games are made both by us and by other developers (for example Backflip Studios, CCP Games, Hello Games, etc). Here's a list of all our games, the [ACORD world backups](http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/forums/forum/droidologists/aod-game-worlds/) and more.

# Integrations
* Slack
* Zapier
* Discord
* Gitlab
* Integromat
* Wordpress

All commits to ACoRD repositories are sent to our discord and forwarded onto the slack (acord-robotics.slack.com). Slack is integrated with a number of applications that we use, for example onedrive. Discord and slack are in constant communication (I.e. syncing) with each other thanks to Zapier.
We use Reddit, Tapatalk & Bbpress for the forums. Reddit can talk directly to discord, but the main problem with Reddit is that the boards are set out differently to traditional forum boards, meaning we consider Reddit as a tool to share the forum posts from the portal on, rather than the other way around. Tapatalk is used also, and there are ways to integrate it with Bbpress, which is one of the tasks of the network dept at ACORD. We need to decipher a method to get the portal talking with everything else (especially the membership features). For example, if a user posts in a specific channel on Slack, it should be sent to a bbpress forum and to discord.
