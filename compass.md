ACORD Robotics, founded in December 2015, is currently creating robots, games, software and hardware for scientists and the public. One of these games is Star Sailors, based on the novella series of the same name, written by the ACORD chairman @IrisDroidology.

Star Sailors is an online-RPG which will be bundled together with StellariOS in the ACORD app.

# Stellarios
Stellarios is a suite of applications that is made by ACORD. Coded in a variety of languages, these apps are games, robotic controllers, and much more.

## Acord app
* Laid out like *Terragenesis* App

## Games
### Unityballs
Github/irisdroidology/unityballs
### Terragenesis

Terragenesis, developed by Edgeworks entertainment, is a space colonization game available for AnDroidOS and iDroidOS. In Terragenesis you pick a planet (for example Mars), and research technology that is used to make your planet more liveable, for example oxygen generators.

The application is really nicely designed and will provide an inspiration for our application. For example, the menu system of Terragenesis will be copied into the DroidOS app. Once you’ve opened a planet in Terragenesis, you see the current state of the planet (for example, a green, lush globe), and this will also be used in the app. See the droid controller section for more.
Droid Controllers

#### TG Stats
* Mercury: 100% (beginner, daughters of gaia)
* Venus: 100% (beginner, united nations)
* Earth: 20% (normal, biosphere, horizon corporation)
* Mars: 100% (beginner, daughters of gaia)
* Moon: 100% (normal, biosphere, united nations)

Once youve opened the droid control part of the app, you’ll be able to select which model of Droid you want to control (including virtual droids.). Once you’ve selected your model, the droid will be slowly spinning around, with different parts of the droid corresponding to different functions (touching the feet will select the movement function, for example).

### Backflip Studio Games
Backflip studios have made a number of awesome games that I've played, including Dragonvale (World) and Gizmonauts (a space & robotics colony game). Backflip studio games emphasise collection of different objects (like dragons) of different types, and the housing of these objects in different habitats. Some stellarios games will follow this model as well, with robots &  aliens being collected, sorted, bred, etc.

### Portal Pages
#### Stellarios
Stellarios is available for ACORD members on the portal. Every single application that has been created is on its own page:
* [Stellarios Portal](http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/stellarios)
* [Star Sailors Game](http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/stellarios/star-sailors)
* [Minigames](http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/stellarios/minigames)

### Themes
Currently we are using the Aardvark theme by Ghostpool, however there are many other cool themes like Buddyboss and Thrive (which we used last year.) We are always on the lookout for cool new themes, however right now Aardvark does the job well.

### Resources
You can find out how the portal works here: http://acord.tech/portal-help

### Gitlab
We're going to be using Gitlab as a secondary git client. Gitlab and Github will be filled up with more projects and people once we've got more active members (however we will be attempting to get 1 contribution each day on each git client).

* [Gitlab Group](http://gitlab.com/acord-robotics)
* [Gitlab Profile](http://gitlab.com/irisdroidology)

* [Gitlab Repo](http://gitlab.com/acord-robotics/robodev/s2-rdstellarios)

The github repository will be made private once we upgrade to a more expensive Github plan. Then both the gitlab and github clients will be private

## OpusTheRobot
My name is Liam, also known as Opus, and I'm the Chairman & Co-Founder of ACORD (formerly Alliance of Droids). I've got plenty of cool things that I will be sharing on this repo, including personal things:

# Maintenance
This repo has been moved to acord.tech/gitlab/acord-robotics/robodev/stellarios
Any changes on github will be reflected in gitlab. Bitbucket? This is to ensure that online cloud-based IDE code editors can be used. Gitpod is currently our editor of choice

This repo on acord.tech/github will be used for jekyll only, however it will still be updated from gitlab.
Backing up: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/raketasks/backup_restore.html#rsync, https://gitlab.com/acord-robotics/robodev/star-sailors/issues/9

## ACORD Members Stuff
* Chairman's stuff: http://acord.tech/opus
The theme we're thinking of using is https://github.com/artemsheludko/adam-blog. This could also be used for the Star Sailors blog - this repo is now for the book navigation.  We forked that repo: http://github.com/irisdroidology/otr

# Stellarios
Stellarios is a suite of software being developed by ACORD Robotics. This software includes games, applications and tools used in a variety of situations, for example software used to control explorartory rovers. The ACORD only version is being developed on Gitlab/Acord-Robotics/Robodev/S2RD and Github/IrisDroidology/S2RD

# Discussion

Every member of ACORD gets the ACORD package of Stellarios, which includes:
* All "droid" blueprints & build logs
* All "holograms" (video archives)
* Virtual companion robot
* All ACORD "Jedi Archives"
* Star Sailors (novella series) - special edition
* Star Sailors RPG access on ACORD portal

Stellarios is free for personal and commercial use and is open-source. Joining ACORD is free and gets you plenty of cool stuff only available to ACORD members. It's easy to sign up - go to http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/signup

# Stellarios Droids
Droids, or robots, are a major part of the work that ACORD Robotics does. These robots will be used for a variety of purposes, including scientific exploration ([NASA-JPL](http://github.com/nasa-jpl)), mental health stability (Blue Frog Robotics), and other uses.

Our prototype of our master droid, A0-D2 (7), or S2-RD (43), is being built and has been worked on since the formation of ACORD/AoD, however we physically started working on it at the end of 2017. The parts list is available here: [acord.tech/partslist](https://irisdroidology.github.io/otr/meeting-with-adventures/)

A0-D2 Build Log: https://acord-robotics.github.io/stellarios/a0d2-log

# ACORD Robotics/Stellarios/Acord-Games
A large part of the Stellarios software suite by ACORD is our games. These games are made both by us and by other developers (for example Backflip Studios, CCP Games, Hello Games, etc). Here's a list of all our games, the [ACORD world backups](http://allianceofdroids.org.au/aod/forums/forum/droidologists/aod-game-worlds/) and more.


# Stellarios
Stellarios is the official operating system and app of ACORD. Stellarios will be designed to work on MacOS & Windows devices, and there will be apps created for Android, iOS & Linux devices. Stellarios is going to be a bundle of applications that will be used by ACORD Corporation members to perform certain operations. 

## Applications
### Droid Control App
Our droids (companion, scientific, etc) will be able to be controlled from this part of Stellarios. Once you click on the button to send you to the droid control app, you will select the type of droid you want to pair with (companion, scientific), then the class (steampunk, et, etc), then the model name (Sp-D2, a0-d2, etc. 

Once you've selected your droid, you will find a cross-section diagram of your droid with different parts highlighted - 

* Legs = movement
* Holoprojector = talk/message (http://replika.ai)
* Dome/Head = Programs

#### Dome
Clicking on the dome will zoom in on the dome and give you a number of programs -
* Battery - low battery mode. The physical droid will turn off and send itself to your phone or device. This means you can interact with a virtual version of your droid
* Games - games like Star Sailors. Hosted on the app, and your offline progress sent to the servers. There will be online features too that require an internet connection
* Science - experiments, research, tools
* Writing/Drawing/Art
* will be able to control our droids and play or games, like A0-D2 and Star Sailors 
* Can interact with replika.ai

## Other applications
* Other games, mini-games
