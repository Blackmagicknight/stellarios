# Manacaster & Star Sailors
Starts off with Asteroid Dodgers as the demo level - to get you used to controls. You're flying a "Star-Hopper x_model_name" as Opus + your character

After you complete the tutorial mission, collecting some artifacts:

* Siridium star - crystal from living crystal aliens (like Mace Windu's lightsaber)
* Entry key - into the game (acord logo 3D)

On the level selector, the story is there (movie credits format)


## Level Intro 
Opus pops up.
