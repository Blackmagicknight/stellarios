# Game Introduction
Welcome to our galaxy. Created by the Alliance of Droids, Star Sailors is what at first seems like a game for members of the Alliance of Droids. However, Star Sailors is much more than that. An imaginary galaxy full of planets, stars, nebulas, and beings mining minerals and living life, The Milky Way was previously home to a handful of life-bearing planets. Now it is the centre of a vast number of alien species that were drawn towards the Milky Way by an unknown source. One of those aliens was you.

Over the 14 billion years of the Universe’s existence, and the 200 million years since the original humans went extinct, aliens are settling into the Milky Way, creating lives that they are proud of on different planets. Earth and the Solar System have been wiped from the face of the galaxy, however some astro-archaeologists believe traces of the human homeworld remain. All the other planets across the universe that have given rise to life have similarily been destroyed, but again historians have not given up on the search.

On your Solar Sailor Starship, you have come back from suspended animation and are descending to the galactic capital, Midgard. You now have to remember which homeworld you came from, your skills and personality, and your species.


# Earthlings
Earthlings

Coming from planet Earth, Earthlings, or humans, have been around for around 300 million years, with their home planet coming into existence 4.8 billion years ago.Shortly after achieving intelligence, the wet, organic humans became silicon-based artificial intelligence, allowing virtually infinite life. Shortly after this, the first generation of humans – the organics – went extinct.

# Keplernians

# Miydlians ** actually good guys
The Miydlias were the first species to succesfully colonize a large portion of the galaxy, and they did so roughly 15000 years ago. A war-loving people, the Miydlias were infamous for their conquests, where they would invade planets to further their cause.
After they left their homeworld (which has since been lost to our records) they settled on a volcanic planet called Miydli, which is where they got their name from. Over millenia, the Miydlias terraformed the planet to be the snowy capital of the galaxy that we called Midgard (of the Midgard Legacy).

# Acridlic
The Acridlic people are an unknown quantity. Fine manufacturers of starships and a technological superpower, today they are now more machine than flesh. Some say they are descendants of the Miydlias, some say another species altogether. The Acridlic make their home on Midgard, the galactic capital.

# Cancrinites
From the 55-Cancri system, the Cancrinites followed a very similar evolution to humans. Starting off as biological lifeforms, over thousands of years the Cancrinites uploaded their consciousness into robotic, silicon-based bodies. Some say  the humans helped them with this.

# Infiniraid Rules
Objectives of Infiniraid
To get more goals than the opposition

Equipment for players

Jetpack
Wearables?


Jetpack

Different eggs can charge jetpack?


How the game works

Each team has a nest of "eggs" that they protect
The opposition tries to steal these eggs
Once they steal the eggs, they evade the opposition
The players with the eggs have to try to hatch them by throwing them to each other. Different eggs have different times to spawn. They have to make sure they don't give up the eggs


Types of players

Collectors - collect the eggs
Retrievers - chase the chasers
Defenders - protect the eggs
Throwers - throw the eggs
Shooters - shoot the alien creatures
Other defenders -  defend against other creatures

To-Do: Add these to-dos to issues, new names for players, more to come, punishments if "throwers" don't pass the ball to the shooters in time or get "tackled" by retrievers
