# A0-D2 Log
This log, which will also be published on the gh-pages branch of this repository, is yet another build log for our longtime project A0-D2. However, what makes this document different is that this is only going to be categorizing the work that we have done with Declan Conlan, a representative from InclusionWA.

# Rotary Groups
We have created an email template & we have also sent out a number of calls to different rotary groups, however at the time of the initial commit of this file we have not yet received funding from any rotary groups.

# CLPG
We have started to fill in the form from clpg.org.au
