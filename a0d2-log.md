# A0-D2
A0-D2 is the second major project that ACORD has worked on. The first one, A0-D1 (aka Sp-D2), is a steampunk-styled R2-unit that is currently being built by myself (Liam) and my uncle, Ian. 

A0-D2 is part of the major project of the "droid" S2-RD, which includes the software suite of Stellarios. 

## A0-D2 Build Log
### 2015
During the formation of the Alliance of Droids (which has been turned into ACORD Robotics), we (Nicholas & myself - the founders) wanted to make an "ultimate" droid. Sp-D2 was the first stage in this goal, which has become a learning experience while still being part of our Alliance. 

We were formed on the 23rd of December in 2015, and not much else happened during that year.

### 2016
During the very early stages of 2016 (like the first few days of January), I got together with Ian to work on a stationary (non-moving/motorized) droid, called Sp-D2 (Steampunk-D2). This project is also code-named A0-D1, as the first project built by the Alliance of Droids.

After I left Victoria, where Sp-D2 had (and is still) been built, I set to work on turning the AoD into a proper company. This included creating a proper website and coming up with new ideas for the ultimate droid. 

### 2017
I had started working with Inclusion WA on my droid during this year.

### 2018
I adapted the R2-D2 Builders club Styrene plans (astromech.net) at the Perth Artifactory.

# S2-RD
S2-RD (Science, Spawn (Creation), Robotics, Development) is the ultimate goal of ACORD. It consists of goals from both our members and our organisation as a whole:

* Completion of PHYSICAL *A0-D2* & A0-D1
* Completion of Stellarios by ACoRD (including virtual, connect versions of droids)
* Plans for future generations of A0-D2 (as in A0-D2.1, A0-D2.2)
* Scientific robots + discovery

**Personal Member Projects that are part of this project**
* Liam - Completion of HS, Uni, full-time job - https://github.com/IrisDroidology/school
* Liam - scientific discovery
* Liam, Nicholas - Partial sale of ACORD
* Liam - Collection (see https://www.notion.so/gizmotron/ACoRD-Robotics-1edd973ac48447e5a1efae3e2af6a2e5)

These personal projects have been added to S2-RD as the point of ACORD is to bring happiness, purpose and creativity to our world and our lives, as well as the lives of others. These goals are our major goals in life and S2-RD will not be completely finish until these goals have been achieved in a way
